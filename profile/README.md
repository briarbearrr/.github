# 🛠️ Fency

**Fency** is an AI chatbot built to transform how homeowners buy fences.  
It helps answer three big questions:

- 💰 **How much does a fence cost?**  
- 🎨 **What style of fence should I buy?**  
- 🧰 **Which contractor should I hire?**

But that’s just the start — Fency helps homeowners **compare quotes**, **evaluate contractor quality**, and **make smarter, more confident decisions**.  
It’s your trusted buddy through the entire fence-buying process.

## 🌟 Why Fency

Buying a fence today is confusing — pricing is opaque, options are overwhelming, and finding a reliable contractor feels like guesswork.  
Fency fixes that by combining **real pricing data**, **contractor ratings**, and **deep product knowledge** to make fence buying **transparent, fair, and actually enjoyable**.
